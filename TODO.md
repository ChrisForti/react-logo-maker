# React Logo Maker - TODO & Progress

## üéâ Recently Completed

### ‚úÖ Custom Toggle Hook Implementation

- **Created `useToggle.ts`** - Custom hook for managing toggle states
- **Added `useMultipleToggles`** - Efficient management of 16+ toggle states
- **Replaced individual useState calls** - Cleaner state management in App.tsx

### ‚úÖ Enhanced UI/UX with Individual Toggle Sections

- **Reorganized EditPane layout** - Each option now has its own toggle switch
- **Eliminated grouped toggle section** - More intuitive individual controls
- **Added 16 comprehensive toggle sections**:
  - Brand, Shape, Text, Style, Position, Rotation
  - Transparency, Effects, Image Upload, Image Filter
  - Animation, Margin, Background, Border, Size, Padding

### ‚úÖ Responsive Logo Preview

- **Made SVG fully responsive** - Scales properly on all screen sizes
- **Mobile-first layout** - Stack vertically on mobile, side-by-side on desktop
- **Improved export quality** - Dynamic canvas sizing for better PNG exports
- **Touch-friendly interface** - Better button sizes and spacing

### ‚úÖ Fixed Background Color System

- **Added SVG background rectangle** - Background now part of the actual logo
- **Proper export integration** - Background included in both SVG and PNG exports
- **Transparent container approach** - Cleaner rendering approach
- **Toggle-aware color filtering** - Colors show/hide based on feature toggles

## üîß Technical Improvements Made

### State Management

- Consolidated 16+ individual `useState` calls into single `useMultipleToggles` hook
- Better TypeScript typing with `React.SetStateAction<boolean>` support
- Cleaner prop passing to components

### Component Architecture

- Individual toggle sections with consistent styling (`bg-slate-600`)
- Responsive grid layouts (`grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2`)
- Better component separation of concerns

### Responsiveness

- Mobile-first design with Tailwind breakpoints
- Aspect ratio preservation (`aspect-square`)
- Flexible layouts (`flex-col lg:flex-row`)

## üöÄ Next Steps & Priorities

### High Priority (MVP Features)

1. **Logo Shape Improvements**

   - [ ] Add more predefined shapes (hexagon, diamond, star)
   - [ ] Implement custom shape upload
   - [ ] Better shape positioning and sizing controls

2. **Text Styling Enhancements**

   - [ ] Font family dropdown (Google Fonts integration)
   - [ ] Text effects (shadow, outline, gradient)
   - [ ] Multiple text elements support

3. **Color System Expansion**
   - [ ] Color palette presets
   - [ ] Gradient support for backgrounds and text
   - [ ] Color picker improvements (recent colors, favorites)

### Medium Priority (Enhanced Features)

4. **Advanced Design Controls**

   - [ ] Layer management system
   - [ ] Undo/Redo functionality
   - [ ] Copy/paste elements
   - [ ] Alignment tools

5. **Import/Export Features**

   - [ ] Logo templates library
   - [ ] Import existing logos for editing
   - [ ] Multiple export formats (PDF, EPS, WEBP)
   - [ ] Batch export in different sizes

6. **User Experience**
   - [ ] Keyboard shortcuts
   - [ ] Preview in different contexts (business card, website, etc.)
   - [ ] Real-time collaboration
   - [ ] Save/load projects

### Low Priority (Polish & Advanced)

7. **Performance Optimizations**

   - [ ] Lazy loading for complex elements
   - [ ] Canvas optimization for large logos
   - [ ] Memory management for multiple undos

8. **Advanced Features**
   - [ ] Animation preview and export
   - [ ] 3D effects and transforms
   - [ ] Brand kit integration
   - [ ] API for programmatic logo generation

## üêõ Known Issues to Address

1. **Border Size Integration**

   - Border size is in Size section but might be confusing
   - Consider moving to Border section or duplicate controls

2. **Toggle Dependencies**

   - Some toggles depend on others (border color needs border enabled)
   - Need better visual feedback for dependencies

3. **Export Quality**
   - PNG export canvas sizing could be more intelligent
   - SVG export might need optimization for smaller file sizes

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Guidelines

### Code Standards

- Use TypeScript for all new features
- Follow existing component patterns (toggle sections, responsive design)
- Maintain Tailwind CSS utility-first approach
- Keep components small and focused

### Testing Strategy

- Test all toggle combinations
- Verify exports work correctly
- Check responsive behavior on different devices
- Validate color picker functionality

### Performance Considerations

- Monitor re-renders when toggles change
- Optimize SVG rendering for complex logos
- Consider virtualization for large element lists

## üìù Notes

- Current implementation supports 16 toggle options with individual sections
- All colors now properly render and export
- Responsive design works well across devices
- Custom hook pattern is established and can be extended

## üéØ Immediate Next Session Goals

1. **Shape System Enhancement** - Add more shapes and better controls
2. **Font Integration** - Add Google Fonts or system font selection
3. **Color Presets** - Add common color palette options
4. **Export Improvements** - Better file naming and size options
