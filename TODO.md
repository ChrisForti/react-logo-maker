   - [ ] Add style presets (modern, classic, minimalist, tech, creative)
   - [ ] Include brand industry context in AI prompts

3. **User Experience Polish**
   - [ ] Add loading animations and progress indicators during AI generation
   - [ ] Implement success/error toast notifications
   - [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions

### üìà Medium Priority (Future Sessions)
4. **Logo Customization Tools**
   - [ ] Advanced color palette picker with AI color extraction from generated logos
   - [ ] Text positioning and sizing controls specifically for AI logos
   - [ ] Layer system for combining AI base with custom traditional elements

5. **Export & Sharing Enhancement**
   - [ ] Batch export multiple logo variations at once
   - [ ] Social media format presets (favicon, profile pic, banner, etc.)
   - [ ] Share generated logos via URL or direct export to cloud storage

6. **Performance & Optimization**
   - [ ] Image caching system for generated AI logos
   - [ ] Lazy loading for large galleries (50+ images)
   - [ ] Optimize SVG output for smaller file sizes

### üöÄ Future Features (Long Term)
7. **Advanced AI Features**
   - [ ] Logo variation generation (different styles of same concept)
   - [ ] AI-powered brand color palette suggestions
   - [ ] Automatic logo variations for different use cases (dark mode, monochrome, etc.)

8. **User Workflow Improvements**
   - [ ] Save/load logo projects locally with LocalStorage
   - [ ] Logo version history and side-by-side comparison
   - [ ] Template gallery with pre-made styles and AI-generated bases

9. **Integration Features**
   - [ ] Direct export to design tools (Figma, Adobe Creative Suite)
   - [ ] REST API for programmatic logo generation
   - [ ] Webhook integration for automated brand workflows

## ÔøΩÔ∏è Technical Debt & Maintenance

### üîß Code Improvements Needed
- [ ] **Type Safety**: Add stricter TypeScript configs and eliminate remaining any types
- [ ] **Testing**: Add unit tests for AI service and complex logo rendering logic
- [ ] **Documentation**: Add JSDoc comments for complex functions and interfaces
- [ ] **Bundle Analysis**: Optimize package size and remove unused dependencies

### üêõ Known Issues
- **Mobile Safari**: Some SVG rendering quirks on older iOS versions need testing
- **Large Galleries**: Performance optimization needed when 50+ AI images are generated
- **Color Accuracy**: Slight differences between SVG and PNG export colors
- **Border Size Integration**: Border controls scattered between Size and Border sections

### üì± Browser Compatibility Checklist

## üìã Development Guidelines

### üéØ Design Philosophy
- **Radical Simplicity**: Keep code minimal, avoid over-engineering, prefer straightforward solutions
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests only needed for flaky code - focus on complex logic, edge cases, and error-prone areas
- **User First**: Prioritize user experience over technical complexity
- **Performance**: Fast loading and responsive interactions are essential

### ÔøΩ Development Workflow
1. **Plan Small**: Break features into small, testable chunks
2. **Visual First**: Test in browser immediately, not just unit tests
3. **Mobile Consideration**: Design mobile-first, enhance for desktop
4. **Incremental**: Ship working features quickly, iterate based on feedback

### üèóÔ∏è Code Standards
- Use TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Follow existing component patterns and architectural decisions
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Write self-documenting code with clear naming conventions
