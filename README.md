## ü§ñ AI Logo Generation Setup (Optional)

The app works great with professional mock designs, but you can enable real AI generation:

1. **Get an OpenAI API key**:

   - Sign up at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/signup)
   - Go to [API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and create a new key
   - Add billing information (DALL-E costs ~$0.04-0.08 per image)

2. **Configure your environment**:

   ```bash
   # Copy the example file
   cp .env.example .env.local

   # Edit .env.local and add your API key
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-key-here
   ```

3. **Restart the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

**Cost Estimate**: Generating 4 logo variations costs approximately $0.16-0.32
